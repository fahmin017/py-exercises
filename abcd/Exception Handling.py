# The try block lets you test a block of code for errors.

# The except block lets you handle the error.

# The else block lets you execute code when there is no error.

# The finally block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.



# Exception Handling
# When an error occurs, or exception as we call it, Python will normally stop and generate an error message.

# These exceptions can be handled using the try statement:

# Example  
# The try block will generate an exception, because x is not defined:

# try:
#     print(x)

# except:
#     print("got yah..🥱🥱")


#****************************************************************************************************************************


# Many Exceptions
# You can define as many exception blocks as you want, e.g. if you want to execute a special block of code for a special kind of error:

# Example
# Print one message if the try block raises a NameError and another for other errors:


# try:
#   print(x)
# except NameError:
#   print("Variable x is not defined")
# except:
#   print("Something else went wrong")


#*******************************************************************************************************************************

# Else
# You can use the else keyword to define a block of code to be executed if no errors were raised:

# Example
# In this example, the try block does not generate any error:

# try:
#     print("ok alle mwone 😊😊")

# except:
#     print("entho preshnam undallo...")

# else:
#     print("ellam ok aaayi")


#*******************************************************************************************************************************


# try:
#     print(x)

# except:
#     print("entho preshnam undallo...")

# finally:
#     print("njan enthaayalum ivide kaanum 🥱🥱 : power of finally 😁🙌🙌")


#*******************************************************************************************************************************

# Raise an exception
# As a Python developer you can choose to throw an exception if a condition occurs.

# To throw (or raise) an exception, use the raise keyword.

# Example
# Raise an error and stop the program if x is lower than 0:

# x = -1

# if x < 0:
#   raise Exception("Sorry, no numbers below zero")


# The raise keyword is used to raise an exception.

# You can define what kind of error to raise, and the text to print to the user.

# Example
# Raise a TypeError if x is not an integer:

x="fahmin"

if not type(x) is int:
  raise TypeError("only integer are allowed")
